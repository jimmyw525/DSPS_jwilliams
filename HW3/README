A large part of this homework was done in complete collaboration during group meetings.  However I feel as though I solely contributed to the first quarted of Part 2, for example the written parts and the initial
data extraction and manipulation.  My partners were Allie DeAbreu, and Colin Burke.  They contributed especially in aiding with fixing errors in Part One
and helping with all of the datetime convolution.  We unfortunately fell just short of completing this homework in its entirety.  This is due
to a few unexpected hiccups that took us much longer than a reasonable amount of time to finally get through.  I hope that we demonstrated a small
grasp of ideas and goals with what work we did turn in as I felt the majority of our problems came down to syntax.  Thanks and sorry again
for the abridged version of the homework.
